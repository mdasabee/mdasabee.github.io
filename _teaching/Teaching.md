excerpt: "My teaching philosophy is grounded in the belief that all students can succeed in mathematics. I believe that my role as a teacher is to provide students with the tools and support they need to develop a deep understanding of mathematical concepts and to become proficient in mathematical problem-solving. I strive to create a classroom environment that is both engaging and supportive. I believe that students are more likely to learn when they are actively involved in their own learning. I also encourage students to ask questions and to participate in class discussions to develop critical thinking skills, problem-solving skills, and communication skills. Moreover, I believe that it is important to influence student behavior positively. I do this by modeling respectful and responsible behavior in the classroom. I also create clear expectations for student behavior and I provide positive reinforcement when students meet those expectations."
